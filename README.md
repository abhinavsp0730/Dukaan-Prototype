# Dukaan Prototype - A Production Grade Dukaan MVP 
## **Django+PostgreSQL+Redis+Nginx+Gunicorn+Docker Compose ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥**

## Quick Introduction:
This project is a production grade MVP of [Dukaan](https://mydukaan.io/)(DIY platform to create your own E-Commerce store).\
In this project I've used Django for the backend, PostgreSQL for production database, Introduced caching(Redis) mechanism  \
for increasing the throughput of the server and used event+time driven caching invalidation mechanism for invalidating cache. \
Used Gunicorn for the production server, Nginx for revrese proxy and for serving static files. \
Then I have Dockerize my project into 4 containers. i.e Web(Django+Gunicorn), db(PostgreSQL), redis_db(Redis), nginx(Nginx). \
And finally I've used Docker Compose for running multiple containers as a single service.

## Web App walkthrough
(Note: While creating the project my aim was to focus enterily in the Backend part and to implement state of the art Backend Infra. \
So, I've created a very simple frontend by using just html and css. I'm able to do this by leveraging DTL and using my engineering jugadu mind) \
\
The web app is having minimal functionality of [Dukaan](https://mydukaan.io/). i.e Vendors can add their products and manage them using a dashboard. \
Then there is a unique link for each vendor which they can send to their customers. By using this unique link, customers can place the order \
by entering the neccesary details. Each placed orders then are displayed in the order's dashboard of vendor. \
Below are the snapshot of the web app. \

## Optimization using caching mechanism 
Suppose there's a sale for a vendor's dukaan shop. Then there's gonna be high traffic for our backend server. \
For each request of client django is going to do costly query in the db. Because of this the throughput of the \
server is gonna be decrease drastically. \ 
Let's test throughput speed by bursting 100 requests in the vendor's unique link(I have already populated the db with dummy data) 
\

For completing 100 requesting it's taking around ``` 3.38 sec ```. Pretty slow right? \
\
For copinng with this problem I've implemented caching mechanism(redis). Which create a view level cache for each vendors \
```order``` view.
\
Now, let's again test throughput speed by bursting 100 requests in the vendor's unique link but this time having cache enabled .

Insane, this time it take only ```0.95 sec``` to process 100 requests. Which is roughly ```72%``` increase in throughput ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ \

But what happened when the vendor added a new product or make the product unavailable? The customers are still geting the cached page. \
For this problem we've to invalidate cache. Cache Invalidation is a crucial part in any caching mechanism. 
I've implemented two cache Invalidation technique.
1. Event based cahce invalidation.
2. Time Based cache INvalidation.
