# Dukaan Prototype - A Production Grade Dukaan MVP 
## **Django+PostgreSQL+Redis+Nginx+Gunicorn+Docker Compose ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥**

## Quick Introduction:
This project is a production grade MVP of [Dukaan](https://mydukaan.io/)(DIY platform to create your own E-Commerce store).\
In this project I've used Django for the backend, PostgreSQL for production database, Introduced caching(Redis) mechanism  \
for increasing the throughput of the server and used event+time driven caching invalidation mechanism for invalidating cache. \
Used Gunicorn for the production server, Nginx for revrese proxy and for serving static files. \
Then I have Dockerize my project into 4 containers. i.e Web(Django+Gunicorn), db(PostgreSQL), redis_db(Redis), nginx(Nginx). \
And finally I've used Docker Compose for running multiple containers as a single service.

## Web App walkthrough
(Note: While creating the project my aim was to focus enterily in the Backend part and to implement state of the art Backend Infra. \
So, I've created a very simple frontend by using just html and css. I'm able to do this by leveraging DTL and using my engineering jugadu mind) \
\
The web app is having minimal functionality of [Dukaan](https://mydukaan.io/). i.e Vendors can add their products and manage them using a dashboard. \
Then there is a unique link for each vendor which they can send to their customers. By using this unique link, customers can place the order \
by entering the neccesary details. Each placed orders then are displayed in the order's dashboard of vendor. \
Below are the snapshot of the web app. \
